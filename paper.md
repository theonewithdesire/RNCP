# Require No Context Protocol (RNCP): An Open Architecture for Action-Oriented LLM Applications

## Abstract

This paper introduces the Require No Context Protocol (RNCP), a novel architecture for building applications powered by Large Language Models (LLMs). RNCP addresses key limitations in existing frameworks by providing a modular, developer-friendly approach that emphasizes validation, security, and explicit action execution. Unlike conventional LLM frameworks that focus primarily on context management, RNCP prioritizes the reliable transformation of user queries into validated, structured outputs that drive concrete actions. This paper details the architecture, implementation considerations, and advantages of RNCP over existing approaches, particularly the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

**Keywords:** Large Language Models, Agent Architecture, Model Context Protocol, Validation, Action Execution

## 1. Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding and generating human language, leading to their increasing adoption in building intelligent applications across various domains. However, developing reliable, secure, and maintainable LLM-powered applications remains challenging due to several factors:

1. **Output Reliability**: LLMs can generate inconsistent, hallucinated, or malformed outputs.
2. **Security Concerns**: Direct action execution based on LLM outputs poses significant security risks.
3. **Developer Experience**: Existing frameworks often prioritize model performance over developer control and integration.
4. **Flexibility**: Many frameworks are tightly coupled to specific LLM providers or models.

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) [1] and similar frameworks have made progress in standardizing context management for LLMs. However, they often over-emphasize context handling while under-emphasizing the critical action execution and validation components of the LLM application lifecycle.

This paper introduces the Require No Context Protocol (RNCP), which fundamentally reorients the architecture of LLM applications by:

1. Establishing a clear, modular pipeline from data sources to action execution
2. Implementing rigorous validation of LLM outputs
3. Providing flexible, developer-controlled mechanisms for action execution
4. Maintaining model agnosticism while supporting open-source and proprietary LLMs

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) introduced a standardized approach for managing context in LLM applications, with a focus on:

- Context window management
- Retrieval mechanisms
- Query routing
- Response synthesis

While MCP addresses important aspects of LLM application development, it prioritizes context management over the equally critical components of output validation and action execution.

### 2.2 Agent Frameworks

Numerous agent frameworks have emerged to enable LLM-driven autonomous systems, including:

- LangChain [2]: Provides components for building LLM applications with various tools
- AutoGPT [3]: Enables autonomous goal-driven LLM agents
- BabyAGI [4]: Implements task-based LLM agents with planning capabilities

These frameworks typically focus on tool use and planning capabilities but often lack robust validation mechanisms and clear separation of concerns.

### 2.3 Output Parsing Approaches

Several approaches have been proposed for structured output generation from LLMs:

- Function calling APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Structured prompting techniques (JSON mode, XML tags)
- Post-processing libraries (LLM Output Parser, Instructor)

While these approaches address output structure, they often lack comprehensive validation mechanisms and integration with action execution systems.

## 3. RNCP Architecture

The RNCP architecture consists of four primary components working in sequence:

1. **Context Injection Layer**
2. **LLM Core**
3. **Output Validation & Transformation Layer**
4. **Action Execution Engine**

Figure 1 illustrates the RNCP architecture and data flow.

### 3.1 Context Injection Layer

The Context Injection Layer establishes connections to data sources and builds contextual information for the LLM. Unlike MCP, which emphasizes elaborate context management, RNCP's Context Injection Layer:

- Provides minimal, task-relevant context to the LLM
- Implements schema-aware context building
- Manages authentication and security for data access
- Controls information exposure to prevent sensitive data leakage

Key components include:

- **Data Source Connectors**: Standardized interfaces for different data stores
- **Context Template Engine**: Converts data schema and metadata into LLM-friendly prompts
- **Schema Registry**: Maintains awareness of data structures across sources

### 3.2 LLM Core

The LLM Core provides a standardized interface for interacting with various LLM providers. Key features include:

- **Provider Abstraction**: Uniform API across different LLM services
- **Request Formatting**: Standardized request structures with consistent parameters
- **Response Handling**: Unified response processing regardless of provider
- **Capability Management**: Runtime detection and adaptation to LLM capabilities

The LLM Core remains intentionally minimal, focusing only on the interface between the application and the model provider.

### 3.3 Output Validation & Transformation Layer

The Output Validation & Transformation Layer is a critical differentiator for RNCP, ensuring LLM outputs meet predefined schema requirements before action execution. Components include:

- **Schema Registry**: Defines expected output structures for different actions
- **Validation Engine**: Verifies outputs against schemas
- **Transformation Logic**: Converts between different output formats
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Handles invalid outputs through regeneration

This layer addresses one of the major drawbacks of existing frameworks by enforcing strict validation before any action execution, dramatically improving reliability and security.

### 3.4 Action Execution Engine

The Action Execution Engine provides a secure, controlled environment for executing actions based on validated LLM outputs. Features include:

- **Action Registry**: Defines available actions and their requirements
- **Permission System**: Controls action execution based on user/system permissions
- **Execution Environment**: Provides isolated contexts for action execution
- **Result Handling**: Standardizes error and success responses

By separating action definition from execution logic, RNCP provides developers with granular control over what actions are available and how they are executed.

## 4. Implementation

### 4.1 Core Components

The RNCP framework implementation consists of the following core components:

```typescript
// Core components
class ContextInjector { ... }
class LLMManager { ... }
class OutputValidator { ... }
class ActionExecutionEngine { ... }
class RNCPCore { ... }

// Core interfaces
interface DataSource { ... }
interface LLMProvider { ... }
interface ActionDefinition { ... }
```

Each component implements a well-defined interface, allowing for extensibility and customization.

### 4.2 Data Flow

The standard data flow in an RNCP application follows these steps:

1. **Context Building**: The ContextInjector combines data source information with the user query
2. **LLM Interaction**: The LLMManager sends the context and query to the LLM and receives a response
3. **Output Validation**: The OutputValidator checks the LLM response against the expected schema
4. **Action Execution**: The ActionExecutionEngine executes the appropriate action with the validated output

### 4.3 Extension Points

RNCP provides several extension points for customization:

- **Custom Data Sources**: Developers can implement the DataSource interface for any data store
- **LLM Providers**: The LLMProvider interface allows integration with any LLM service
- **Action Definitions**: New actions can be added by implementing the ActionDefinition interface
- **Custom Validators**: The validation system can be extended with domain-specific validators

## 5. Comparison with Model Context Protocol

| Action Execution    | Implementation-dependent     | Structured, permission-based system                 |
| Developer Control   | Model-centric                | Developer-centric with clear interfaces             |
| Security            | Limited built-in features    | Permission system and validation at multiple levels |
| Model Agnosticism   | Variable                     | Strong with provider abstraction                    |
| Open Source Support | Variable                     | First-class support for open source LLMs            |

### 5.1 Key Advantages of RNCP

RNCP offers several advantages over MCP and similar frameworks:

1. **Validation-First Approach**: By prioritizing output validation, RNCP significantly improves reliability and security.
2. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a well-defined responsibility, enhancing maintainability.
3. **Developer Control**: Explicit interfaces provide developers with fine-grained control over system behavior.
4. **Action-Oriented**: The architecture is designed around enabling concrete actions, not just generating text.
5. **Open Source Friendly**: RNCP is designed to work well with open source LLMs, not just commercial APIs.

### 5.2 Limitations and Future Work

Current limitations of RNCP include:

1. **Implementation Maturity**: As a newer framework, RNCP lacks the ecosystem of mature implementations.
2. **Performance Optimization**: Further work is needed on optimizing the performance of the validation layer.
